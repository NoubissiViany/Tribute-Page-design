        <div class="center2">
            <ul>
                <li><b>1914</b> <label>- Born in Cresco, Iowa</label></li><br>
                <li><b>1933</b> <label>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <p>to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</p></label></li>
                <li><b>1935</b> <label>- Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <p>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed</p><p>them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</p></label></li>
                <li><b>1937</b> <label>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</label></li><br>
                <li><b>1938</b> <label>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <p>cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under</p><p>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</p> </label></li>
                <li><b>1941</b> <label>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <p>rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT</p><p>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</p> 
                </label></li>
                <li><b>1942</b> <label>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</label></li><br>
                <li><b>1944</b> <label>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <p>pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.</p><p>Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease</p><p>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</p></label></li>
                <li><b>1945</b> <label>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <p>yields</p></label></li>
                <li><b>1953</b> <label>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <p>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to</p><p>provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p></label></li>
                <li><b>1962</b> <label>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <p>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly</p><p>expanding population</p></label></li>
                <li><b>1970</b> <label>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</label></li><br>
                <li><b>1983</b> <label>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize <p>and sorghum yields</p></label></li>
                <li><b>1984</b> <label>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</label></li><br>
                <li><b>2005</b> <label>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <p>that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as</p><p>we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous</p><p>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long</p><p>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best</p> breeds."</label></li><br>
                <li><b>2009</b> <label>- dies at the age of 95.</label></li><br>
